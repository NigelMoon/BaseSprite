# BaseSprite
So i created this thing for the new modders of the community to don't export the images directly and to find a place to get some base texture to start.
For now i don't have a lot of base to the creation of an specific item, but i will try to expand this to everyone who wants to create a sprite.

# Tip
If you are creating an Item in TMod, you can use almost any size, the only thing you need to be aware is that a item needs to be the double of the original size, for example, an image with the size 17x19 needs to be 34x38 to work without a problem.

# Aclaration
The sprites i take wasnt mine, i took it from a Forus or Internet in general, in case of the image doesnt work, please inform.
